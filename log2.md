# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Second Attempt) - 2021

### Day 1: 2020-02-01

**Today's Progress**: Revisited the Java Programming Masterclass on Udemy (Tim Buchalka). Rewatched video lessons and redid assignments on the course.

**Thoughts** Wanted to revisit concepts like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition. Have not really been using in my coding practice, hope to implement in the future.

### Day 2: 2021-02-02

**Today's Progress**: Decided on a project to build, going to work on a gamified training app for dancers. Gearing towards street dance, will just make it a fun app to give to friends

**Thoughts** Meeting with Victor today to discuss the initial plans for the app, going to cater based on his suggestions. As he is a professional, modelling it after his training should provide good results.

### Day 3: 2021-02-03

**Today's Progress**: Working on implementing a "Training Entry" section of the app, created the UI buttons. Creating a script to change variables depending on options selected.

**Thoughts** Creating a central button script that signals the button pressed and sorts type of button depending on Tag type.

### Day 4: 2021-02-04

**Today's Progress**: Created a script for the buttons in the training entry sction. Now highlights the button pressed, stores data in a central area.

**Thoughts** Will be working on a system of competing an entry, then storing in a central area. Still planning best way forward for this.

### Day 5: 2021-02-05

**Today's Progress**: Can now create an entry, saves an entry object into a list in Player.

**Thoughts** Will work on a system of updating the experience points when an entry is made next.

### Day 6: 2021-02-06

**Today's Progress**: Updated the LocalPlayer script, so that stats now update with a training entry. Experience bar moves and levels change.

**Thoughts** Keeping simple, 1 hour = 1 stat depending on tag, and 100 exp per level with req experience curve.

### Day 7: 2021-02-07

**Today's Progress**: Finished the first rough draft of the Training Entry Section, now updates Focus and Status depending on frequency and type of entries

**Thoughts** This is a good time to show to Victor, get an opinion on the entry process. Will clean things up (like make the back button work) later on, but want to create a rough system for each button first. Will be working on the Notebook next.

### Day 8: 2021-02-08

**Today's Progress**: Added a script to create achievements when they occur. After a certain stat point they will be unlocked.

**Thoughts** Used a relatively simple method of setting active state depending on stat point, means the app has to be updated if new achievements are added. Works for now tho

### Day 9: 2021-02-09

**Today's Progress**: Minor changes to Notebook, working on design of UI to get it going

**Thoughts** Spoke with Victor about some ideas for the notebook, he liked the training entry so far, suggested adding an "Intensity" feature which was a good idea.

### Day 11: 2021-02-11

**Today's Progress**: Working on connecting the user to a database, so that the information can be stored. Will also have to create a sign-in screen in that case.

**Thoughts** Going to use firebase for now, seems to be a good solution for this.

### Day 13: 2021-02-19

**Today's Progress**: Getting back into the 2D Platformer, spent some time cleaning up some code and play testing.

### Day 14: 2021-02-20

**Today's Progress**: Remodelled 2D Game, scripted different way of changing rooms. Makes things much easier and cleaner.

**Thoughts** Previous method was to move character to next room when gate touched, but now it teleports to a checkpoint which is much more versatile

### Day 15: 2021-02-21

**Today's Progress**: Completely redid the layout of the game, now more organized and easier to create or modify rooms

**Thoughts** Spaced out every room a set width, and improved placement of gates to remove jank.

### Day 16: 2021-02-22

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the GamifiedPD all day, created a sign-in section to test connection and it worked perfectly. 

**Thoughts** Now that it works, going to try and implement Firebase.Auth to make sign-in more legitimate.

### Day 19: 2021-02-25

**Today's Progress**: Instead of straight coding, learned about design sessions from an experienced software engineer. Got some recommendations for reading materials and learned about a good process for preparing and cleaning up code.

**Thoughts** Interesting comments about keeping code modular for easier use, guideline of around 200 lines per file, and the recommendation to read Clean Code. Ended up purchasing a copy.

### Day 20: 2021-02-26

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time designing the Front end of the application, also playing around with the Sign-in Authentication side

**Thoughts** Figuring out how to store specific player data based on the ID associated with the signin. Not too difficult.

### Day 21: 2021-02-27

**Today's Progress**: Finally connected the UserID to the information on the database for the DancePD. Lots of debugging and frustration

**Thoughts** Theres a strange issue that occurs when trying to pass an object variable obtained through a JsonUtility conversion. Had to use a redundant way of passing the information through (instead of passing an object, had to pass every single variable in the object). Super odd and frustrating but finally works...

### Day 22: 2021-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Worked on finalizing the database, connects perfectly now. Testing with mobile, a couple issues came up

**Thoughts** When testing the build on mobile, the scaling was weird. Need to adjust for that and keep playing around.

1. Git repository not avail - size was too high after incorporating database

### Day 23: 2021-03-01

**Today's Progress**: Figuring out why the UI is so weird when exporting to mobile. Must have to do with the scaling.

**Thoughts** Will continue to play with UI, but will start working on the model measurement system and take a break from the games.

### Day 24: 2021-03-02

**Today's Progress**: Finished up moving platform rooms in BasicPlatformer, now going to code in new types of platforms.

**Thoughts** Next idea is to work on "Sticky Ceilings" i.e. if you touch the platform from below you stick to the bottom of it.
