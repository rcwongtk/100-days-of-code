# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Second Attempt) - 2021

### Day 1: 2020-02-01

**Today's Progress**: Revisited the Java Programming Masterclass on Udemy (Tim Buchalka). Rewatched video lessons and redid assignments on the course.

**Thoughts** Wanted to revisit concepts like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition. Have not really been using in my coding practice, hope to implement in the future.

### Day 2: 2021-02-02

**Today's Progress**: Decided on a project to build, going to work on a gamified training app for dancers. Gearing towards street dance, will just make it a fun app to give to friends

**Thoughts** Meeting with Victor today to discuss the initial plans for the app, going to cater based on his suggestions. As he is a professional, modelling it after his training should provide good results.

### Day 3: 2021-02-03

**Today's Progress**: Working on implementing a "Training Entry" section of the app, created the UI buttons. Creating a script to change variables depending on options selected.

**Thoughts** Creating a central button script that signals the button pressed and sorts type of button depending on Tag type.

### Day 4: 2021-02-04

**Today's Progress**: Created a script for the buttons in the training entry sction. Now highlights the button pressed, stores data in a central area.

**Thoughts** Will be working on a system of competing an entry, then storing in a central area. Still planning best way forward for this.
