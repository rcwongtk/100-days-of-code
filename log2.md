# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Second Attempt) - 2021

### Day 1: 2020-02-01

**Today's Progress**: Revisited the Java Programming Masterclass on Udemy (Tim Buchalka). Rewatched video lessons and redid assignments on the course.

**Thoughts** Wanted to revisit concepts like Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition. Have not really been using in my coding practice, hope to implement in the future.

### Day 2: 2021-02-02

**Today's Progress**: Decided on a project to build, going to work on a gamified training app for dancers. Gearing towards street dance, will just make it a fun app to give to friends

**Thoughts** Meeting with Victor today to discuss the initial plans for the app, going to cater based on his suggestions. As he is a professional, modelling it after his training should provide good results.
