### Day 7: October 04, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the platformer game, adding some new mechanics and preparing for upload to a LinkedIn Post

**Thoughts** Running out of ideas for the levels, quite difficult when you are restricted to a one room size (self imposed restriction though!)

### Day 10: October 07, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing hololens development, going through the getting started tutorials. Decided to go the pure Unity C# route for more flexibility.

**Thoughts** Don't think I will be using the Enklu route, will try to develop my own programs first.
