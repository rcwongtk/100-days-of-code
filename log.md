# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first iteration of my Valve Catalogue app.

**Thoughts** Excited to be a part of this challenge, tend to be off and on when I work on personal projects. Hope to see this through to the end.

### Day 1: September 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added two levels and some new scripts for the basic platformer game.

**Thoughts** Decided my goal with this platformer will be 100 levels, then will just leave the game for anyone to play for free.
