**Today's Progress**: Debugging Toastmasters application so the WebGL Build actually works.

**Thoughts** Lots of errors have prevented WebGL from working, needs to be absolutely error free for it to work.

### Day 10: October 07, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing hololens development, going through the getting started tutorials. Decided to go the pure Unity C# route for more flexibility.

### Day 12: October 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Did a check on the program on Unity, filmed the tutorial and posted it on LinkedIn. Continuing to work on the tutorial
