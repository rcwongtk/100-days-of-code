# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the first iteration of my Valve Catalogue app.

**Thoughts** Excited to be a part of this challenge, tend to be off and on when I work on personal projects. Hope to see this through to the end.

### Day 1: September 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added two levels and some new scripts for the basic platformer game.

**Thoughts** Decided my goal with this platformer will be 100 levels, then will just leave the game for anyone to play for free.

### Day 3: September 29, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Debugging Toastmasters application so the WebGL Build actually works.

**Thoughts** Lots of errors have prevented WebGL from working, needs to be absolutely error free for it to work.

### Day 7: October 04, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on the platformer game, adding some new mechanics and preparing for upload to a LinkedIn Post

**Thoughts** Running out of ideas for the levels, quite difficult when you are restricted to a one room size (self imposed restriction though!)

### Day 10: October 07, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing hololens development, going through the getting started tutorials. Decided to go the pure Unity C# route for more flexibility.

**Thoughts** Don't think I will be using the Enklu route, will try to develop my own programs first.

### Day 12: October 12, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Did a check on the program on Unity, filmed the tutorial and posted it on LinkedIn. Continuing to work on the tutorial

**Thoughts** May as well upload this onto Github, will just hide the model as it is proprietary information. Hoping to make another video when updating the application.

### Day 40: November 09, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Tackling how to get the model properly downloaded and utilized in the software

**Thoughts** Having difficulties, so for now going to leave as a to-do and have the program just use a model already loaded into it.
